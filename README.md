# Dix-cordes
Dix-Cordes is my personal project, a communication platform inspired by Discord. It includes live chat and peer-to-peer live calls, and is built using Vue.js 3, PeerJS, Socket.IO, and PostgreSQL for the backend. The project aims to provide users with a seamless and dynamic communication experience by combining the advantages of real-time messaging and voice communication.

Check out the live demo [here](https://dixcordes.julianoouvrard.com/). Please note that the demo is reset every 24 hours.
