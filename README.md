# Dix-cordes
Dix-Cordes is my personal project, a communication platform inspired by Discord. It includes live chat and peer-to-peer live calls, and is built using Vue.js 3, PeerJS, Socket.IO, and PostgreSQL for the backend.
The goal of this project is to create a fast and efficient live chat experience that can be hosted locally.
Dix-Cordes strives to deliver users a seamless communication experience by integrating the benefits of real-time messaging and voice communication.
