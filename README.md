# Dix-cordes
Dix-Cordes is my personal project, a communication platform inspired by Discord. It includes live chat and peer-to-peer live calls, and is built using Vue.js 3, PeerJS, Socket.IO, and PostgreSQL for the backend.
The goal of this project is to create a fast and efficient live chat experience that can be hosted locally.
Dix-Cordes strives to deliver users a seamless communication experience by integrating the benefits of real-time messaging and voice communication.

Check out the live demo [here](https://dixcordes.julianoouvrard.com/). Please note that the demo is reset every 24 hours.

## Features
- **Live Chat:** Engage in real-time conversations
- **Secure Communication:** Messages are securely stored using AES encryption
- **Enhanced Security:** A floating keyboard emerges when sending a message to prevent keylogger threats
- **Live Call (Peer-to-Peer):** Direct video communication with others through peer-to-peer live calls
- **Global Accessibility:** Dix-cordes features English and partially supports French, German, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese
